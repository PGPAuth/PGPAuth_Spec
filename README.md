# PGPAuth Specification

This repository holds the specification of PGPAuth. You can use it to
develop custom apps and servers compatible with all the other PGPAuth-
compatible programs.

Please try to integrate your new features in existing apps first, to prevent
having the user choose between features only in app A and those in app B.

If you create an app for a new platform, you can get a repository in the
PGPAuth organization here on GitHub, giving your app an "official" state.
